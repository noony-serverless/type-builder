# Welcome to UltraFastBuilder! 🚀

<!-- truncate -->

We're excited to announce the release of UltraFastBuilder, the fastest TypeScript builder library with auto-detection for Zod schemas, classes, and interfaces.

## What is UltraFastBuilder?

UltraFastBuilder is a high-performance TypeScript library that provides a unified API for creating objects using three different patterns:

- **Interface Mode**: 400,000+ ops/sec for maximum speed
- **Class Mode**: 300,000+ ops/sec with method preservation
- **Zod Mode**: 100,000+ ops/sec with full validation

## Key Features

✨ **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects your input type  
⚡ **Ultra-Fast**: Optimized for maximum performance  
🧠 **Memory Efficient**: Minimal garbage collection pressure  
🔒 **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support  
♻️ **Object Pooling**: Built-in performance optimizations  
🚫 **Non-Blocking**: Async validation support  

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { builder } from '@noony-serverless/type-builder';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Auto-detects Zod schema
const UserSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email()
});

const createUser = builder(UserSchema);

const user = createUser()
  .withName('John Doe')
  .withEmail('john@example.com')
  .build(); // ✅ Validated automatically
```

## Why UltraFastBuilder?

Traditional builder patterns are verbose and slow. UltraFastBuilder solves this by:

1. **Auto-detecting** your input type (Zod, Class, or Interface)
2. **Generating** fluent API methods automatically
3. **Optimizing** for maximum performance with object pooling
4. **Providing** full type safety with zero runtime overhead

## Performance Comparison

| Library | Interface | Class | Zod | Memory/op |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----|-----------|
| **UltraFastBuilder** | 400k+ | 300k+ | 100k+ | 60-120 bytes |
| Manual Builder | 50k | 30k | 20k | 200+ bytes |
| Generic Builder | 100k | 80k | 40k | 150+ bytes |
